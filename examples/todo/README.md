# Bugs:
- Item focus doesn't remain when toggled.
- Edit input focus not working due to htmx event not firing.

# Thoughts
- Out of band swaps are confusing, though they work well.
  - Eliminate them, or find a pattern for them that isn't confusing.
  - This kind of goes with using id's in general, which limit composibility.
